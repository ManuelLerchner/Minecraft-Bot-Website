  <p>
    As previously mentionend, building the state-machine from scratch is not a
    very pleasing task. so I decided to create a more abstract way of
    programming the minecraft bot, which allows us to use high-level
    abstractions like an <code>if</code>, <code>while</code> and
    <code>try</code> statement.
    <br />
    I had the idea, that insteady of writing the states and transitions by hand,
    it would be much more interseting if a "compiler" could handle that boring
    job. You just have to give it a high-level abstraction of the things your
    minecraft bot should do and the compiler assembles the underlying
    state-machine for you.
  </p>

  <p>
    Instead of creating the states manually and writing every single transition
    you could write something that describes the task in a more high-level way:
    For example to write a small cobblestone-mine program, you could write
    something like:
  </p>

  <textarea highlight-js [options]="{}" title="cobblestone-farmer-simple">
  while(bot has less than 10 cobblestone){
    equip bot with pickaxe;
    goto cobblestone generator;
    mine cobblesonte;
  }
  </textarea>
  <p>
    A compiler would take that and compile it into a state-machine, that the bot
    can execute.<br />
    The state machine from the sample program above would look like this:
  </p>
  <figure class="fullWidthImg">
    <app-smart-image
      [src]="'/assets/images/cobblestone-miner-small.png'"
      [title]="'Cobblestone-Mine-Program-Small'"
    >
    </app-smart-image>
    <figcaption>
      <p>
        This is the state-machine that the compiler creates from the given
        program. The main program flow loops around in the while loop, until the
        exit condition is met.
