  <p>
    The Task Node is the most simple node. Its modeled as an abstract class as
    you can see in the UML-Diagram. Its direct children then implement the
    actual logic.<br />
    When you compile it, it just returns the action asociated with it, and
    wheter that action can possible fail, thats it. At this level there are no
    transitions yet because were dealing with a single actions, in other words
    we are handeling a single states of the state-machine.<br />
    <br />
    An example of a <code>TaskNode</code> is for example a
    <code>GoToNode</code> which tells the bot to go to the specified
    coordinates. <br />
    In the following image you can see how a <code>GoToNode</code> gets
    compiled:

        This is what a compiled GoToNode looks like. Its very simple and doesn't
        contain any transitions yet. Its main task is to represent an action
        which the bot can directly execute.
