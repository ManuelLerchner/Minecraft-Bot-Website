  <p>
    In this project I wanted to explore the
    <a href="https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer"> mineflayer-api</a>
    which allows an easy creation of minecraft bots.<br /> But instead of just using the predefined
    api to create bots, I wanted to create my own bot-language, which allows me to easily reprogram the bots.
    The following video shows what we are going to build in this project:

    </video>
    <p>
      This is a video of the bot running a wood-farming program. The program itself can be programed and adapted to your
      needs very easily, as I build a own programming language and a compiler for effectivly writing bots.

    The start of the project was rather dragging because the way you're supposed
    to program the minecraft bot is by creating a state-machine, aka a
    deterministic finite automaton.<br />
    As you can imagine, creating a state-machine by hand is a very long and
    nerve wracking process, even for smaller programs. <br />For example, this
    is just a small section of a handwritten cobblestone-mine program:

        const compassPort: CompassPort = new CompassPort(bot, "compassPort", 12);
        const goToHome: GoToHome = new GoToHome(bot, "goToHome", "home");
        const idleState: BehaviorIdle = new BehaviorIdle();
        const gotoCobble1: GotoXZ = new GotoXZ(
            bot,
            new Vec3(216, 64, 179),
            "goto cobble 1"
        );
        const mineCobble1: MineBlocks = new MineBlocks(
            bot,
            new Vec3(215, 65, 179),
            new Vec3(216, 65, 180),
            "mine cobble 1",
            5,

        );
        const gotoCobble2: GotoXZ = new GotoXZ(
            bot,
            new Vec3(214, 64, 181),
            "goto cobble 2"
        );
        ...
    }

    initTransitions(){
        ...
        //serverstats -> compassport
        new StateTransition({
            parent: printServerStates,
            child: compassPort,
            shouldTransition: () => true,
        }),
        //compassport -> goToHome
        new StateTransition({
            parent: compassPort,
            child: goToHome,
            shouldTransition: () => compassPort.Done(),
        }),
        //gotoCobble1 -> mineCobble1
        new StateTransition({
            parent: gotoCobble1,
            child: mineCobble1,
            name: "Mining Cobble1",
            shouldTransition: () => gotoCobble1.hasReached(),
        }),
        ...

  <p>
    It is obvious that this way of "programming" a minecraft bot isn't very
    efficient. You have to explicitly tell the program each node and every
    single transition between those nodes individually.<br />
    It's a dull way of programming, and the human brain isn't very good at
    planning such kind of structures. <br /><br />
    If you consider how big state-machines can get, you can barely imagine how
    much code you would need to write, even for a "small" program. There has to
    be a better way.

        This is the state-machine behind a cobblestone-mine-program with
        automatic storage and reequipping of pickaxes. It's rather complicated
        and would be very difficult to write from scratch.
